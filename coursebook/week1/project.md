## Project

### Build a one-page portfolio website for you and your team

We want you to work together over the next few days to build a small site from scratch the provides a short profile for you and your team.

To describe what features should be implemented, these are the [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) that should be satisfied;

As a **client looking to hire a team of developers**
> I want to **visit your site and immediately see a headline about your team**

> So that I **get a concise description of what you have to offer me**.

As a **client looking to hire a team of developers**
> I want to **visit your site and see a navigation link for 'About, Team, and Contact'**

> so I can **quickly navigate to the areas of the site I'd like to visit.**

As a **client looking to hire a team of developers**
> I want to **be able to contact the developers by filling out and submitting a form by providing my name, email and message information**

> So that **the team have sufficient information to contact me afterwards**

As a **client looking to hire a team of developers**
> I want to **click on a navigation link and a corresponding section be made visible in the browser window on the same page**

> So that I **can quickly navigate around the site without having to wait for new pages to be loaded.**

As a **client looking to hire a team of developers**
> I want to **easily view the site when browsing on my mobile, tablet or desktop**

> so that I **can understand the sites content easily on whatever device I choose to view it in.**

As a **visually impaired client...**

> I would like to **easily read and understand the text on your site**

> so I can **understand the information available**

As a **blind client...**
> I would like to **easily understand how to navigate the site after my screen reader reads me the content of the site**

> so I can **understand the information available**.

As a **client who still uses Internet Explorer 7 on an ancient TINY computer with JavaScript disabled for annoying security reasons**
>  I would like **to visit your site and get a similar experience to viewing your site on a modern browser**

> so that I **don't feel like I'm completely in the stone age**.

## Build Process (Tuesday-Wednesday)

Your team needs to set up a new repository under the [gaza sky geeks organization](https://github.com/gazaskygeeks), and work together over the next few days to commit changes to this repository, as well as include a README file that should three points -
- WHAT (describing your site)
- WHY (describing the purpose)
- HOW (describing the journey to completion)

You may also add more ambitious features in the README which describes **stretch goals**. Feel free to add the user stories from this project guide into your README too.

When working together, groups should split into pairs, making sure they are constantly communicating with each other.

Divide the tasks between the pairs, and decide how you will work together to avoid conflicts in your code.
However you decide to individualise your site is up to you, but aim to satisfy the user stories.

Your blog should have profiles of each of your group members and each profile should include links to your *Linkedin*, *Github* and *Codewars* accounts.

## Publishing (before 6pm Wednesday)

On completion, your site should be published via *github pages*. Your README should also include a link to the live site. You may decide to publish early (perhaps to check how it looks on mobile?)

## Tips

We will also be checking your site for accessibility on [Tenon.io](https://tenon.io/)

- Try drawing out rough sketches of your site first and agree on a design to work towards throughout the project
- Adding issues to your github repo is highly recommended, so you can easily keep track of what needs to be done/resolved, and who should be responsible.
- You ~~may~~ will encounter merge conflicts when working together on the same files. Don't panic, discuss the conflicts with your team before reaching a resolution.
- If you decide to use and stick to a particular naming convention for your CSS classes before starting the project then that's awesome! At the very least, aim to organise your CSS rules so they grouped together well and use clear descriptive class names.

**Note: You should stop working on your profile after 6PM wednesday.**

**WORKING ON YOUR SITE FROM HOME AFTER 6PM THURSDAY BAD, DON'T DO IT**

**On Thursday morning, you'll be swapping code with another team and raising issues on their code, before resolving issues that you have received.**

**You will present your project to the rest of the cohort on Thursday afternoon, so aim to factor in 30 minutes - 1 hour of time during Tuesday-Wednesday to discuss how you will present your work.**

**Also, if you don't manage to complete the project, or if it doesn't work by the time it comes to presenting- don't fear! You should aim to present your progress to the rest of the cohort, not a fully polished finished site.**

**We'll be here if you need any support.**

**Good luck :)**
