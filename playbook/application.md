# How to apply

**STEP 1**
Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/).

**STEP 2**
Join our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/gazaskygeeks_bootcamp/codingforeveryone).

**STEP 3**
Join [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/).

**STEP 4**
Join [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com).

Note: When joining Codewars, you will be asked to solve a basic coding exercise.
If you cannot solve it, please skip this step and return to it when you have
spent a few hours practicing Basic JavaScript on Free Code Camp.

When you signup put as your clan: Gaza Sky Geeks.

Note: You can easily use your GitHub account to join Freecodecamp and Codewars.

**STEP 5**
[Create an empty repo](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) on GitHub,
where you will eventually build your own one-page website.

**STEP 6**
A) Prepare an application video that answers these questions (if you do not
  want to video yourself, please do a screencast instead):

- Why do you want to do join the programme?
- How would you like to use technology to help others?
- What do you intend to do when you finish?
- What really motivates you?

Make sure you keep it to under two minutes.
Use YouTube or Vimeo or a similar service.
Record your voice at an adequate sound level.

B) Complete the application form.

Your application will be considered only after the closing date for applications,
so you can continue to work on Codewars and Freecodecamp (See COURSE PREREQUISITES
  below) until that date.
You can expect to hear from us within 14 days of the application closing date.

**COURSE PREREQUISITES**

If you want to be accepted, you want to at least make sure you complete these
three steps before the application closing date.
1. If you have not done any programming before, then you will probably need to
  allow yourself a minimum of 100 hours on Front End Development on
  http://www.freecodecamp.com/ before you are ready to tackle Codewars.

2. Aim to get to at least 5 kyu on https://www.codewars.com/ by the time the
  application window closes. We find that this process typically requires a
  minimum of 100 hours of study.

3. Create at least one kata: https://www.codewars.com/kata/new/javascript.

4. Referring to step 5* from the instructions to apply for the programme, edit
  the repo you created to end up with one-page website using GitHub pages. https://pages.github.com/

**Note** We recommend not using frameworks like Bootstrap. Also, using Jekyll
is entirely optional.

Other recommended materials can be found in the recommended section.
