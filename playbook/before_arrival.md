# Before you arrive

### Get a laptop

If you do not yet have a laptop, get one. If you want something inexpensive, a ChromeBook with at least 4GB of RAM is a good option.

### Set up a dev environment

Get your computer set up for software development. 

If you have a Mac, you are more-or-less ready to go. 

If you have a ChromeBook, you will want to install Linux, using [crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton). If you want help, then just [try google](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=crouton). There are several decent tutorials out there.

If you have a Windows PC, you may want to consider also installing Linux on it. It can be a bit of a pain, but is probably preferable (at least, in our experience) to trying to work with Windows. Good luck.

### Get familiar with the command line

We are going to be spending a lot of time working on the command line. If you don't know anything about the command line, then try Zed Shaw's [CLI Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/).

### Learn the basics of HTTP

Here's a [pretty good introduction](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/webprogramming/HTTP_Basics.html).

### Git

Work through our [Introduction to Git and Version Control](https://github.com/NataliaLKB/learn-git-basics).

### READMEs and markdown

This document is a README. We are going to use them a lot on this course.

Read [Readme Driven Development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html) and then, if you do not already know markdown, complete [this short tutorial](http://markdowntutorial.com/).
